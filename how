struct for each flow containing arrival, thread id, transmission time, and prioritu, input file order

start prog
initialize flow structs put in pool
start timer
each tick, check for ready threads in pool if none running
start the correct one with function that takes arg of amt of time to sleep
and sleeps for that amount of time
can we continue counting time while waiting for a thread?
if so just wait on the thread, then check for waiting threads, arbitrate, and continue
